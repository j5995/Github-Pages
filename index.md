I really like cats. Below is a picture of cat if you've never seen one.

## Sports
I also enjoy playing sports.
Some of these include:
- basketball
- table tennis, also known as ping pong
- pickleball
  
I also enjoy playing badminton but I haven't the chance to play too much considering you need to have a court and someone to play with.
## Very important quote
I really like and live by this quote:
>do unto others as you would have them do unto you

## Code related
My favorite language is C/C++.

My favorite command from C/C++ has to be `printf()` specifically because of the amount of times I've used it to debug before I learned that gdb existed.

## Personal life
I really really like [cats](#cats). I haven't been home in a while, so I haven't been able to pet any cat for that matter, which has had a heavy impact on my mental. (Not really but I really want to pet a cat)

I've recently gotten a bit into sad/love songs.
Here's a list of my top 3 artists (this is an opinion don't flame me):

1. Gigi Perez
2. Billie Eilish (VERY recent change)
3. Conan Gray

I also have a couple of short-term and long-term goals I wish to achieve here.

- [ ] Invest time in personal projects
- [ ] Be comfortable with SystemVerilog, Java, and Javascript (Python as well but maybe not this quarter)
- [ ] Manage time better for classes, studying, and sleep (and gym if I can)
- [ ] Graduate this quarter with a 3.7+ gpa
- [ ] Obtain an internship and/or research
- [ ] Find what I want to go into industry for
- [ ] Be a better friend, son, brother, and in general, person

But that's about it. If you want to read the read me for this site, click [here](README.md).
